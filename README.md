## Git for NORMAL Developers, by Joseph Reynolds
I've been developing a series of talks discussing Git from the perspective of the elements most necessary for the everyday developer doing everyday work. 
If you've been to one of these talks, thanks! 
You're welcome to grab the slides and source here. 

If you can't make it to a talk, there are links in each of the session descriptions below, for my slides and source code. Of course, you can always get the most up-to-date version here at GitHub... It just won't have the specific "live updates" that are made during a given talk.

## Abstract
Are you a developer who recently started using Git in VSTS? Maybe you've been using it for a while, but your team needs some help with branching and merging? Or maybe you just want to see some of the tools out there that make Git easier to use?

This is the class for you! We're going to focus on what most of us do 75% of the time in Git, and how to use that to make your life easier.
