## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Are you a developer who recently started using Git in VSTS? Maybe you've been using it for a while, but your team needs some help with branching and merging? Or maybe you just want to see some of the tools out there that make Git easier to use?

This is the class for you! We're going to focus on what most of us do 75% of the time in Git, and how to use that to make your life easier.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jmreynolds/Git-For-Normal-Developers/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
